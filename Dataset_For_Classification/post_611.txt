For females! GRAD STUDENTS!
Hi I’d prefer to find a grad student to share my room with this year. I’m  going to be a second year grad! I’d like to find somebody that I genuinely connect with as I’d like to have a good relationship with my roommate. 587.50 a month. This apartment is like 20 steps to campus so it’s a great deal. Utilities are only $7.50 for wifi and $5-8 for electricity. Garbage and water are free! Laundry is on the first floor! This is right across campus and included are some photos. Priority given to single room interested people and shared right after!
