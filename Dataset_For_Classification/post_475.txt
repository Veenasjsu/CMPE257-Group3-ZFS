Hey, me and my roomates are looking for a female Roomate to take the master bedroom which is 1100+150 utilities which includes wifi, water, Gas, electricity and washer and dryer. The House is 2 blocks away from SJSU. The house comes with a back yard and a garage providing a ton of free parking for us. The room is individual rent so you wouldn’t have to worry about the rest of the groups rent if that’s a concern for you as well. Let me know soon!!! Because we want to find a Roommate that the rest of us would get on with before the landlady finds someone else to take the room.
