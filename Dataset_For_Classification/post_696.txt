Hello! My name is Amanda and I am an incoming MSW graduate student to SJSU in Fall 2023. I am looking for a private room preferably with other grad students or to get a group together of other grad students to look for off campus housing near the university, who are LGBTQ+ friendly. Feel free to message me if you are looking for something similar & we can get to know each other & start looking!
