Hi, I’m a senior at SJSU living at one south market, and me and my roommate are looking to fill our master bedroom room with 1-3 people. Rent for the room is 1900 altogether, so 950 or 633.33 each if 2 or 3 people. The master bedroom has its own private bathroom and big walk-in closet. The place is a 10 minute walk from campus. I already have a couch, television, silverware/dishes, and most necessities here, just ask for more details. The lease would start in August. Contact me if you are interested!

here’s a link of the floor plan:
