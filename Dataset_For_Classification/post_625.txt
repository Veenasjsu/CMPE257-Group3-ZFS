Hey, looking for someone (male) to take over my current apartment half a mile away from campus. It's 2bd 1ba; you get a private room and share a bathroom with my roommate. The room is huge (look at the pictures, the bed is a full for reference) with two attached closets. 

You would take over the rent starting around June 24th (slightly flexible)

Rent is 1050 per month plus utilities and a security deposit.

If you smoke, you can smoke in your room and drinks are fine. 

Pet friendly.
