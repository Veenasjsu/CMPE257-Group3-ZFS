Urgently looking for 2 or 3 more female and male roommates to rent/apply a house with a backyard close to
SJSU. Budget 1000-1250$ (flexible) a room including everything. Currently I have a girl roommate friend who is on board!
Looking for people who are chill,
communicative, respectful, friendly and keeping common areas clean, 420, Igbt, and alcohol friendly.
The thought of wanting a backyard is to not give crazy parties but to enjoy our little get together times with friends and roommates, possibly small celebrations, or study sessions!
Feel free to share your room with a friend or significant other.
I have a few houses that I am in contact with so feel free to reach out to me ðŸ™‚ Time is short!
