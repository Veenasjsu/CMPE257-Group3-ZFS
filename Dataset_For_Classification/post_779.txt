Hi everyone!
LOOKING for a 3rd roommate to share a bedroom at 508 S 11th street Apartments. I'm Charvi and I will be a third year Aerospace Engineering student at SJSU next year. My roommate and I are looking for a third roommate. My roommate has a private room to herself and I'm looking for someone to share a room with my me for the next school year. Rent is approximately $750. Water and garbage is covered. PG&E/electricity and wifi are not covered. we are on the first floor of the apartment building and there is a washer and dryer right across from our apartment. The common area is furnished. The apartment comes with heating but no cooling. We are about a 5 minute walk from campus and are looking for female only roommates. Also both parking spots are taken so if you wanted to bring a car, you would have to find street parking. I've attached some pictures. The room in the pictures below is actually my roommate's room and is already taken but my room looks very similar and has 2 closets. We were planning on moving in beginning of August and renewing our lease in September. Please message me if you have any questions or wanted to schedule an in person tour!
