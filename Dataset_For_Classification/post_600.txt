Hi all,
I’m looking for a female roommate or roommates to find off-campus housing with. I’m a transfer student going into the Animation program and will be turning 20 this fall. I‘m a pretty neat person and can keep to myself but I am very amicable and would love to be good friends with my roommate! If you are interested and would like to get to know each other let me know and feel free to message me.
