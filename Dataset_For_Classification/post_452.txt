*Looking for FlatMate *

Hi everyone! We're looking for a fifth roommate (FEMALE ONLY) to occupy the hall spot at our 2b/2b at Colonnade Apartments starting this fall. The lease is new and a year long starting August 11th. 

Rent should be around 550 without utilities.

There's four of us, International students from India, sharing each bedroom. Preferably looking for Indians with no pets, who is clean and accommodating. Please reach out if you're interested. Thank you!
