Hi, my name is Alana and I am looking for potential roommates to sign a lease starting around June or July or an open room in a house near SJSU!

I am graduating from Dartmouth College this spring and starting grad school in the meteorology department at SJSU this fall. I will be doing research full time in the summer and part time during the school year. Iâ€™m respectful, clean, and very friendly. I love spending time outside, making jewelry, and spending time with friends.

I am looking for people who are friendly and wanting to do things together on the weekends or in the evening! Ideally looking for people 21+ who are clean and have a stable income.

I have a budget of around $750-$1200 per room, and am looking for something within walking distance to SJSU, but open to something closer to downtown San Jose. PM me if you think we might be a good fit!
