Hi there, my lease is ending in early November, im looking to move into a house with a garage space and in unit laundry. Iâ€™m looking either for a space to rent with these amenities, or 1-3 roommates to move into a house together. I currently have my friend with me and we both work full time and are SJSU students.  Please leave a comment or message me if you are looking to find a place off campus towards the middle of October- early November. Thank you! (We are both male, and are open to anyone wanting to join us in finding some form of affordable housing)
