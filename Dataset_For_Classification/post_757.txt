URGENT POST! I'm reletting a double occupancy room (Bedroom A) in a D1 floorplan (floors 3-7), where the lease starts August 19, 2023, and ends July 31st, 2024. Rent is $1223, with utilities included! This is an urgent post since I was planning on moving into The Grad next semester but was accepted into another school and need to find someone to take over by JUNE 1ST!!

• You would be sharing the space with someone else, but it's a very large room. There are separate closets and an attached shared bathroom.

• Super close to campus, probably around a 5-minute walk at most

• Fully furnished (FULL XL bed, desk, etc.) & in-unit washer and dryer

• Amenities: Pool and deck, fitness center, Outdoor areas, Study lounges, etc.

As common courtesy of signing with such limited time, I would like to offer some amount of money as a gift. If you need help paying the pet deposit or need something for your future apartment space, I would love to pay it off as a thank you. 

Please message me ASAP if you are interested or know someone else who would be interested! My Instagram is @agape.t and my phone number is 669-226-8194
