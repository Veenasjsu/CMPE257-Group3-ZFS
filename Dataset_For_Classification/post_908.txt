Hello! My name is Carmen and I am student at SJSU! I am looking for a room to rent/sublet for next fall. I will be studying abroad Spring of 2024 so I would only need a place starting in Mid August to Mid December 2023. My budget is around $800-900 and would preferably like to live within a walking distance of campus, but I also will have my car so it is not a deal breaker if not. 

Please let me know if you have a space or if someone you know has a space!
Thank you so much!
