Hello! We are looking for a housemate to take over the masters bedroom in our 2 floor 3bedroom and 2.5bath townhouse in Campbell. It will be available on July 1st for $2000 a month. The masters room has its own bathroom and a walk in closet. It can fit two people if preferred.

About the townhouse: it is located in a nice and quiet neighborhood on Sunnyoaks Ave. You get a view of the lake on the second floor. It is close to downtown Campbell which has Farmers Market every Sunday (4 minutes away) and grocery stores. Mitsuwa (a Japanese grocery store) and Westfield Valleyfair is only 10 mins away. There are lots of storage and space. HOA + garbage fees are paid by landlord $360~. WiFi, water, & pg&e are split. There is plenty of street parking and in unit washer and dryer (on the second floor). 

About us: We are both working professionals in Campbell. We are in our 20s, quiet, clean, organized, responsible, and mindful of others. 

What we are looking for: We are looking for one or two female working professionals to take over the masters room. You must be responsible and have a good credit score. We prefer someone who is clean, quiet, and does not party. No cats. 

Tell us a little bit about yourself! Weâ€™re excited to meet you! :)
