Looking 
Hi! I am looking for a place to stay for the next year at SJSU and prefer to have my own room but would be ok with a shared room. Preferred move-in date is the 19th as I am moving from one part of the state to the other. My budget is around $1,000 - $1,200 (utilities included).Let me know if you have any apartment avaliable.
