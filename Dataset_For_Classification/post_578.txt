Hi, I’m a senior at SJSU living at one south market and I have space for one single room and one shared room with 2 or 3 people. Rent for the single is 1250 a month and the double (master bedroom) is 950 each, I already have a couch, television, and most necessities here, just ask for more details. it’s about an 8 min walk to campus if you’re a student. The lease would start in August. Contact me if you are interested. Thanks!

here’s a link of the floor plan:
