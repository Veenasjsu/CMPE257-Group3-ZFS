Looking for someone to take over my lease of the master bedroom with a private bathroom in a 1400 sq ft. 2-bed 2-bath apartment with a flexible move in date after 10 July 2023. The apartment is in downtown San Jose close to highways 87, 280, 480 and 680 right across San Pedro square and close by SAP Centre as well as walking distance from SJSU. The rent is $1550+ utilities and the lease ends in November but can be extended further and it comes with a designated parking space in the buildingâ€™s secure parking structure.You will be sharing the apartment with a super chill and laid-back individual in her early 30s, ensuring a relaxed living environment. Looking for a female roommate for her and preferably someone vegetarian. The apartment has a strict no smoking policy and sorry the land lord does not allow any pet in his unit.Reach out to me for any further questions. Open to students who can share the room.
