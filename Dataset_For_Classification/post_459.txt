URGENT!!! 
Hi everyone, i’m a junior transfer international student at SJSU
and i’m looking for a single room( also i’m open to shared room as well). The budget that i’m hoping for is around 600-800. i would like to move in first of August(8/1) if possible. if anyone has a open spot for housing or want to share bedroom together, send me a message. 
Thank you
