Hey! My roommate and I are currently looking to fill a private room available for mid July-early August. Place is about a 3 minute drive from SJSU and in a nice neighborhood. Girls only and sadly, no pets allowed. Rent is about $1170 a month + Utilities. There is an in unit washer and dryer and plenty of parking space. Plus a shared bathroom with one person (me). There is a security deposit of $1165 as well. Both of us are also very clean and respectful of shared living areas. Let me know if interested ðŸ™‚
