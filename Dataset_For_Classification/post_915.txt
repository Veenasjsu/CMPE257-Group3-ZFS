Hi everyone,
I will be interning in the bay area over the summer and I'm looking for housing from mid-May till mid-August. I'm looking for something closer to campus and I'd prefer to have my own room but I don't mind sharing a bathroom. I study Computer Science and Data Science at UW Madison and enjoy most things outdoors, sports, cooking, and trying new food. If you or anyone you know is subleasing for that time period or even if you want to just connect lmk and I'd love to talk. Thanks!
