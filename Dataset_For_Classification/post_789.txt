Hey. I am a full time student at deanza college looking for a single room. My current lease ends in may so anything with a move in date before June 1st would be great. 

- My budget is 800-900
- I am super chill and clean up after myself 
- I am either studying or playing games in my free time. But also always down to hang out 
- preferably a place close to the bus stop since I donâ€™t have a car.
Please let me know if you have anything available
