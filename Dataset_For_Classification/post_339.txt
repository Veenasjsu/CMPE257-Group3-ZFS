Hello all,

Looking for accommodation:

Me and my brother are looking for a private bedroom with attached bath, preferably only until the end of December or a month to month lease around San Jose.
Our budget for the room is $1300. We are friendly, also keep to ourselves, clean and mostly be outdoors.
A parking spot is needed if available.

Please let me know if you have any availabilty.

Thanks,
Harsha
