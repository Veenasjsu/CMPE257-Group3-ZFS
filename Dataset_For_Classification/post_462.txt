Hello!
I am an incoming transfer student who will be starting this fall at SJSU. 
I am looking for any private or shared room(s) for the fall-spring semester. A close walk to campus is preferable for me. 
I don't mind what gender I live with
My budget is 600-750$ a month with utilities included 
I am looking to move in around the second week of August 

Please reach out to me if anyone knows of any avaiable rooms!
Thank you!
