Hey everyone,

I have a room available from May 25th till Aug 6. There are 2 bedrooms, but I am looking to sublet my single private bed/bath.

The unit comes fully furnished, with a washer/dryer as well. The lease price for the private room is $1560 (including utilities), but I am open to negotiate!

Please contact me if you are interested! I can even set up a call to show you around the place.
