I will be a San Jose State graduate student for the fall quarter of 2023. I am quiet, studious, and like to keep my space clean and tidy.
My budget is $600-$800 a month for a room
Or I can also rent a parking space for $200-$400 a month

Please let me know if your room or parking space is available for rent. 

Thank you!
