Hello! I am looking for someone to rent a room in my condo for the semester in South San Jose. $1600 per month, includes utilities (free parking, WiFi, lots of streaming services, heat/AC, washer/dryer, water, garbage, etc.). I work at SJSU and am also a Masters student. Also, I like to cook and enjoy cooking for others and growing food. If youâ€™re interested, please reach out. Willing to negotiate price. Thanks
