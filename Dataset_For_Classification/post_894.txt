Hi everyone! Iâ€™m planning on renewing my lease for my apartment this august and my current roommate is moving out in July. It is a 2 bed 2 bath with in unit laundry and ac/heating. Itâ€™s right on market and thereâ€™s street parking you donâ€™t need a permit for! It is right next to Sofa market and is a 15 minute walk to campus. I currently share my room with my boyfriend, who works full time, and I am a masters student at SJSU for clinical mental health counseling:) weâ€™re both really clean and respectful but are hoping to find someone who is also clean, respectful & friendly. We would also prefer people who are working or pursuing a masters degree. The rent would be $1,200/month not including utilities. Please feel free to message me if youâ€™re interestedðŸ˜Š
