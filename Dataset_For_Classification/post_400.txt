Hello everyone, I'm Merve, a 26-year-old female. I'm currently in search of a room to move into around  3rd or 4th weeks of August although I am flexible with the dates. While having a private bathroom would be preferable, it's not a deal breaker for me. 
I am looking specifically in the areas of “Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Palo Alto, and Santa Clara.” 
-I don't smoke, I am vegetarian, and I don’t have any pets. 
*If you have an available space that seems like a good fit, please feel free to reach out to me. Thank you! 🌸
