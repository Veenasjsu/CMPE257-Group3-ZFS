ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ URGENT ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

Hi! I have a private single bedroom available at One South Market Apartments. The apartment is a 3bed 2bath, and I'm looking to fill one of the single bedrooms (10.5 feet by 10 feet) ASAP for the beginning of November or even mid-October (prorated rent). Rent is $1250. The living space is also really nice and the building has a gym, pool, and is right in downtown, about a 7 minute walk to campus. I've included photos of our living arrangement below, 2 photos of the room, a photo of the bathroom, photos of the common area with the kitchen and living room (plus one of the roommates Ebe), the dog kennel, and the view from the balcony. The place is available for immediate move in.
Please message me if youâ€™re interested or have any questions!
