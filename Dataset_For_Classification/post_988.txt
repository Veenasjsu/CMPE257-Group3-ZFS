Hi! My housemates and I are looking for 1 roomate to share a room with me and renew our lease in May. This is a coed house, but I would prefer a FEMALE  roommate who doesn’t smoke/doesn’t do drugs/no hosting parties. Rent is $700 plus utilities of about $30 (electricity & wifi). We also have a Guinea pig named Jerry who lives with us. 

Our place is across from south parking garage and Duncan hall. There’s street parking and you can talk to the owner to see if you can pay extra for a parking spot at the apartment. Once you renew lease, you can move in by June. Feel free to comment or message me with any questions you have!
