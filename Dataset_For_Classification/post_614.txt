Available! 

There’s two rooms available in Milpitas for $885 a month. It’s a 5 bedroom coed home (15-20 minutes to SJSU) with 3 other SJSU students. Utilities are about $110 a month on average, it depends because trash and water is charged every other month. There’s plenty of street parking since it’s a residential neighborhood, a shared kitchen, and you’d have a shared bathroom with one other person. The bed in first room pictured can also stay, otherwise the rooms are unfurnished.

Need new applicants to apply to apply by JULY 1ST, but move-in date isn’t until August 1st. Deposit is $1000.
