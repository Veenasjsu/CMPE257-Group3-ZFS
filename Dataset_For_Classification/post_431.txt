Hello I am looking for a place for the new school year . This will be my last year at SJSU. My budget is between $500-$700. I am open to sharing rooms with someone or having my own room I donâ€™t mind either one. I am a responsible and organized person. If you would like to become potential roomates or are in need of a person to fill in a place please reach out !
