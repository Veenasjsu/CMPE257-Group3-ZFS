Update, I got a few responses already but would like to have two to three more people so we can get a larger house where rent is cheaper per person.

Hey yall, I see a lot of listings for female only places and not as much postings for male college students. My roommate might be moving out, and if that's the case, I'm planning on relocating, and I'm looking for roommates. (I have a budget of 1150 per month).
If you are a guy looking for roommate(s) for next fall (move in this summer);
Cool with bringing over friends once in a while but not trying to party every day;
Is willing to look around for a place;
And preferably in an engineering major and have some matching interests with me (hitting the gym, gaming, guitar, demo ranchüòÅ, and watching a movie once in a while)
Message me and comment here. If we don't end up rooming, maybe you'll meet someone else you can look around with.
