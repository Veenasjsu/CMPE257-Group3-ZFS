Hello! 

Our home has a room available for rent now!

We are a home of 2 females in our twenties, looking for someone close in age to move in. Looking for a single occupant with no pets who is easy to get along with and is respectful of others and shared spaces. Lease is month to month, but we prefer someone looking to stay for an extended period of time.

The atmosphere at our house is chill and we strive to maintain a clean space to live in ðŸ™‚ 

About the home:

Monthly rent: $1,033
1 Months security deposit required. 
Utilities are not included. Monthly utilities (water, internet, gas, electricity) come out to about $150.
There is a washer and dryer in our home. Driveway available for parking + street parking available.

If you have any questions or are interested in the room, please send message. Please include a short description about yourself (what you do for work, hobbies, what youâ€™re looking for in housemates, etc.) ðŸ˜Š
