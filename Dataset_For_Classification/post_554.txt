Hi everyone! I’m a 21 year-old transfer student coming into SJSU as a music major. I’m looking for a private room for rent with a budget of $1000 and under, with a long lease (10-12 months). I prefer an all female apartment or unit and I don’t mind sharing a bathroom. Approximate move-in date would be the first weekend of August.

I’m very clean and friendly! Please message if looking to be possible room/housemates! Please message if anyone has any rooms available!
