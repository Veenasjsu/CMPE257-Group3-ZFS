Hi! 

Iâ€™m interning in the San Jose area from 16th June to 26th August and Iâ€™m looking for place to live near campus. 

My internship will be a little north of the airport, so a place close to public transport would be ideal. Iâ€™m good with doing a ~30 mins commute. My budget is < $1500, but Iâ€™m flexible! 

Generally, Iâ€™m quiet, clean, and friendly! ðŸ™‚

Please let me know if youâ€™re willing to sublease your place or have any ideas about where to look!
