Looking

I have a room for rent $1,300. Utilities split. You will have a spacious room with a balcony and a shared bathroom with another girl. 

Some information on the house, We are located in the Evergreen area of San Jose. We live in a gated HOA community with security patrolling the area therefore its a really super friendly and safe neighborhood. 

The ideal tenant we are looking to rent is someone who is clean, tidy and respectful of the common areas. No pets or smoking allowed in the house. We are a super minimal and clean household so if you are any of those qualities mentioned above then we would be a great match for you. 

The property itself is 3 bedrooms and 2.5 baths. Move in date is August 1st. There are nearby grocery shops that are 8 minutes away and downtown is about 15 minutes driving distance.
