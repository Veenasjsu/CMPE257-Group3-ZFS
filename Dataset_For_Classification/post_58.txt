Hi, I have one private room available for a female at nearby San Jose State University. 

ğŸ›Œ1 Bed 1 bath unit on the 19th floor 
ğŸª‘Fully furnished (Bed, mattress, desk, couch, TV, Chairs, and chair for your desk) 
ğŸ’¡Utilities included (wifi, AC/Heat, Water, Electricity)
ğŸ’°$1729 + $12.95 (renters insurance) 

The apartment has everything a student needs!  From Study Rooms located on each floor, to a large and always available Amenity Deck.  Take a dip in the pool, get your sweat on at the gym, cook some amazing food at the grills, or study in one of our many study rooms.

You can move anytime you want. Please let me know if you are interested!
