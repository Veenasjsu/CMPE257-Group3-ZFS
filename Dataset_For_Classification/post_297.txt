Hey all! My friend and I are looking to move in a 3 or 4 bedroom townhouse with other potential housemates. We’re looking for someone who is open to searching for a new place together in north san jose. I got my B.S. in civil engineering last year and currently working in construction. I love most outdoor activities/hangouts! I’m a laid-back person who prefers to keep the space neat and tidy. I am learning to cook! (veg), spend most of my time outdoors, and sometimes read/relax. I go into the office everyday. My friend is a 27 yo working professional who is fits in the above description. We are looking for a long-term housemate who is clean, responsible, and is open to having friends over on some weekends. As well as being respectful of noise levels on weekdays! No gender preference!

If this sounds like a good fit, please send me a message. We are looking to finalize a place by the end of September/early October. Thanks!

Additionally, since I will be moving out of my current place, I will be looking for replacements. If you are interested, feel free to reach out for more information!
