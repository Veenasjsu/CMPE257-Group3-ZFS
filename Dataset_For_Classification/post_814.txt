LOOKING, Either (Please read first paragraph)

My name is Jayce Lee, and I will open this post up by stating that I am a transgender man (born female). I also own two rats that will not be let out of their cage - I promise they are friendly, and I clean the cage often. If neither of these facts make you uncomfortable, then please continue reading.

I am looking to share an apartment at least 10 miles from SJSU, however, if you are further than that, please do not hesitate to reach out. My budget is $1,000/mo, but I am willing to go up to $1,300/mo on special occasion. I am looking to move in at the start of the new Fall semester (mid August), and looking to stay until either the end of that same Fall semester. I can reliably make payments on time, and send money electronically through Zelle or Venmo.

Now, about myself: I'm a kind, friendly, and understanding person who can adapt well to changes or preferences of other roommates. I keep my own bedspace and shared spaces clean. I will not be bringing many things, so I will be able to occupy a small space of the house. I have a good sleep schedule, and would appreciate an apartment that does not hold loud parties or meetings after 10PM. I am part of AROTC, so I have a busy schedule and may not be home very often.

Overall, I'm very easy to get along with, and looking for roommates that will not dislike me for my identity. I do not mind rooming with all females, as long as I am respected.

Thank you for reading!
