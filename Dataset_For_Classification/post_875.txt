Hello,
I am starting my masters at SJSU in August and am looking to rent a room for $1000 or less. Ideally month to month lease or no commitment beyond December so that I can get a feel for the area and community.
A bit about me: I am 24, Canadian and passionate about wildfire (thatâ€™s what I will be studying). I enjoy cooking, reading, music, and outdoor adventures. I also like spending time with friends and sometimes have them stay with me if they are visiting from out of town. 
Please message me if you have any leads!
