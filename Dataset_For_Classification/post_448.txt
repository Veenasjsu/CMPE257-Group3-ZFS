Hi ,
I am Rushank and I just started working in the bay area.
I am looking for a place to rent starting end July / Early August. (Cupertino/Santa Clara/San Jose). preferably near Apple.
I am looking for a private room with an attached bathroom or starting a new lease with the new apartment.  (preferably 2b2b) Near to Cupertino
About me:
I am vegetarian, non-smoker, and like to keep the place clean.
I like to play badminton and enjoy doing hikes. I love playing board games and cards.
Anyone who already has an apartment and looking for a rommate or someone  who is in the same boat as me looking for a place please message me and we can look for place together.
