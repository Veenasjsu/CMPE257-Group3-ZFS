About Us:
Currently, there are 3 of us co-leasing this unit. We are all in our early-mid 20s and have at one point or another attended SJSU. We are reasonably clean and make every effort to do our part around the place. With that being said, busy and chaotic lives sometimes get in the way of a perfectly pristine environment, though, it's not that bad. If you're interested, you are definitely welcome to come by and check out the place to see for yourselves! Message me if you are interested.
