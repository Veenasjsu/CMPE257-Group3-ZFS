*Looking for Accommodation*
Hey everyone,
I hope this post finds you well! I am currently on the lookout for an apartment to rent near San Jose State University starting August 15th'2023. 
If you or someone you know has a place available, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
Ideally, I'm looking for a one-bedroom apartment with a reasonable rent or even a shared one with close proximity to the university. I am open to join an existing lease or start a new one
Please feel free to message me with any leads or recommendations. I greatly appreciate your help in my search for a new home!
Thank you,
Kritika
