*I posted a few months ago and the person backed out last minute :/ *

Currently LOOKING for one female housemate (22-28 yrs old) for my 2Bd1Ba. *3 blocks* from SJSU, about an 8 min walk! I currently work full-time and may attend grad school.

**MOVE IN: June (can possibly negotiate the date!) **

Message me if you are interested or would like to know more :) I'm willing to Zoom and meet in person! 

Non-negotiables: 
* cigarette smoking
* pets
