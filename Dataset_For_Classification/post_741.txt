looking for roommates, female only!

Hey everyone, my roommate and I are looking for 2 female housemates to occupy 2 separate single rooms in a 2 story, 4 bed 4 bath townhouse about 4 blocks from SJSU. The house is newly constructed, with beautiful new furnishing. Occupants’ co-signer should have an income of at least 5x the rent ($1500) or $7500 monthly income. 

I’m a Sociology transfer and my roommate is a Psychology transfer. We’re both from the Bay Area as well. 
Message me if you’re interested / details !
