Hello, 

Women Only

Currently, we have 3 people in our apartment and Iâ€™m looking for one more that would be rooming with me.

The apartment includes 2 bathrooms, on-site laundry, and parking.

The deposit would be $600 and the shared rent would be $579.62. Utilities are about $40. The lease is 12 months. 

470 Apartments are a 9-minute walk from campus and a 2-minute drive from campus.  Move-in would be in late July/ early August 
Please contact me for more information and pictures
