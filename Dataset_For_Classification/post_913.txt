Hi everyone ! 
I’m subleasing my room from May-July 19. It’s a bedroom with a restroom & a walk in closet in a 2b 1.5 bath apartment.  The apartment is shared with two other Sjsu students. The rent is $1280/month or if you’d like to have a roommate the room would be $640/ month each. Please contact me if you would like to see the apartment in person or would like to see pictures ! The apartment is located on S 9th st, right next to SJSU.
