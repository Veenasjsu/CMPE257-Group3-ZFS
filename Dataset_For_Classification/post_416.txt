Hi! I have a spacious master bedroom available at One South Market Apartments. I’m looking to fill it with two people sharing or just one person. Rent is $1900 or $950 each and it has its own walk in closet and bathroom. The living space is also really nice and the building has a gym, pool, and is right in downtown, about a 7 minute walk to campus. I’m not there right now but I do have a video of the floor plan. Message/comment for more details!
