Room with half bath available starting July 1st in 4 bedroom home. The room is $1025/month with utilities around $50-100/month, and is located right next to the Diridon Station (light rail/trains/busses), the SAP Center, Whole Foods, Cahill Park, and the Alameda shopping district with lots of restaurants and amenities. SJSU campus and downtown is super accessible by light rail or car (10 mins). It is a gorgeous million dollar home and you can't beat the price in San Jose for what you get.
Check out the pics here: (the first two room photos is the one available)(& there is no longer carpeting - all the rooms have new hardwood floors) https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/235-Kentdale-Pl-San-Jose-CA-95126/69299696_zpid/
The current roommates are: 3 spiritual gals and 1 cat named Oreo. We are all in our mid 20's (24, 25, 26) and are either working/or working and in school. We are into astrology and tarot reading, cooking, watching TV, environmentalism, and reading. Two of us have been living here for a year and a half, and the other moved in this year. We enjoy each others company but have our own lives and busy schedules.
Our ideal 4th roommate would be: pet-free (or if you have a pet it would have to get along with our cat), car-free, clean/down to help out with chores, communicative, considerate, 420 friendly, in their mid-later 20s, and someone who does not usually shower before 7-8am (my room shares a wall with the shower and it wakes me up), and is financially stable.
The house was built in 2006 so super modern. If you love to cook, the kitchen is HUGE! There is a 2 car garage so you will have room to store things in it if you would like. There is a really nice park only a few hundred feet away from the front door.
If you think you would be a good fit, please shoot me a message on here and introduce yourself. The more details the better :)
