Hello, I am an international student from Madagascar who will attend De Anza for Fall.

I am looking for a furnished room around De Anza College, preferably in Cupertino, Sunnyvale or anywhere near VTA bus route 23, 25, 51 or 55 

I am a quiet person who don't smoke, I don't do alcohol nor drugs.

My budget is between 700 - 1100 $, and my preferred moving date is on September 1st.

Please reach out.
