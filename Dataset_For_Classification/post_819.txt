Looking for a roommate to move into a 2 bed/1 bath apartment on the south side of campus starting June 1st. Very close to campus and the split would run about 1000 each. It says no pets. Pm me for more info and pics, but I would like someone who is generally clean, respectful, and willing to communicate. Thank you.
