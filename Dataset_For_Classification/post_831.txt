Hi everyone, [LOOKING for Both]
I'm an Environmental Studies major from the University of Michigan Class of 2021 and I'll be working at the San Jose Conservation Corps as part of the California Climate Action Corps fellowship this summer.
I'm currently on the lookout for some temporary housing in South San Jose, Willow Glen for the duration of my fellowship from June to August. If anyone knows of any sublets, or short-term rentals, or has a spare room you'd be willing to rent out, I would greatly appreciate it! My price range is $1500/month.
I'm a friendly and outgoing person and would love to make some new friends during my time in San Jose. I enjoy exploring new places and cultures, and I love to get out of my comfort zone. If you share any of these interests or qualities, let's connect!
Please DM me if interested!
