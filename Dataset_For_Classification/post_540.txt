AVAILABLE AUGUST 1st! This apartment located in South San Jose, off of the Cottle Road exit off of Highway 85 comes entirely furnished (can decorate/furnish differently if you want). This would be a traditional rental where utilities are taken under the tenant's name which will cover HOA payments that includes trash so electric, internet, and water would be the additional charges. You would get your own master bedroom and master bathroom. This apartment will be shared with me. Only looking for a female roommate. Monthly rent would be $2300.
