Hi, 

My boyfriend and I are currently LOOKING for a place to stay near SJSU. Our budgets are roughly $1300 each. We would like a place that has a parking spot and is also located in a safe location. If there is any available, please message or email me (emvalee2002@gmail.com) 

ALSO, my friend (FEMALE) is also LOOKING for a private bedroom with an attached bathroom at The Grad to stay. Please message me if there is any available!
