Update: I’ve found someone! 

Hi! I’m Jimena and I’m looking for a female roommate to share a room with in a 2 bedroom apartment around August 1st. My friend, Aliza, and I are currently undergrads at SJSU and are looking for a place close to campus. Aliza would have her own room, while you would be sharing with me! We are still looking for a place but I have some listings lined up. I’m also open to getting a three bedroom if it fits all of our budgets. Feel free to message me and we can set up a phone call or video chat!
