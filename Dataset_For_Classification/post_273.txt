Hi! I have a private single bedroom available at One South Market Apartments. The apartment is a 3bed 2bath, and I'm looking to fill one of the single bedrooms ASAP for the beginning of October. Rent is $1250. The living space is also really nice and the building has a gym, pool, and is right in downtown, about a 7 minute walk to campus. I've included a link to the floor plan down below. Message/comment for more details!
