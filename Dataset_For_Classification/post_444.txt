Looking for a final fourth roommate to sign a one year lease with! Female only please.

My two other roommates and I are looking for a last roommate to apply for a 4 bd/2.5 ba house 10-15 min walking distance from SJSU. The house is in a very safe area in a residential neighborhood; please message me for pics. The individual rent for this place is $1050 w/o utilities, and includes parking.

We have a zero tolerance rule for alcohol, drugs and smoking in the house due to medical and religious reasons, so please be wary of that. We have two hamsters and are planning to get an ESA animal in the future. We are also disability and LGBTQIA+ friendly!

Lastly, the three of us are good friends who live very harmoniously, and would like a fourth roommate who would fit into that as someone who is as respectful and amicable as us.

The landlady really likes us and we are guaranteed the place as long as we meet all the requirements, etc. We’re looking to move in mid-August, before the semester starts. If you’re interested, please message me!
