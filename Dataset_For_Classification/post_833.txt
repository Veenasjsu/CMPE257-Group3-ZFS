Hello! I am hoping to find roomate/s to find a place for late july or early august. I would be sharing my room with my partner, Carla Gonzalez. We're hoping to pay around $1000 for our room, but can consider paying more. We'd also be bringing our two cats, Mandarina and Mora. They are really well behaved and super cuddly. I'm going to be entering the Multiple Subject credential/ MA program at SJSU in the fall, and Carla will be attending UC Santa Cruz in the fall. Send me a message if you'd be interested in looking for a place to room together :')
