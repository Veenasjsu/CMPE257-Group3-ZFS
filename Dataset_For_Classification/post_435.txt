Reposting from a little bit ago because I’m still looking for roommates for 2bed 1bath 

Hi! My name is Nguyen, I’m 23years old, and I’m looking for roommates for the 23’-24’ school year. I’m going to be an incoming junior  next fall & am looking to join a group of girls!

- I love going out on the weekends as well as meeting new people but definitely make school a priority too!
- I’m pretty open to having friends over regularly 
- I’m a sociology major & love going to the beach, listening to music, and exploring cool spots
- Looking to be in a single or double, but open to a triple if I really vibe with the girls!
- I’m pretty clean and organized too
- Would love to be good friends with my roomies and go out together!
 
Kindly dm for more information
