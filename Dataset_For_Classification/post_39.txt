Hi! We have one room available in a 5-bed/2-bath house on the south side of San Jose. The room is located about 1.5 miles away from SJSU.
We are all SJSU students, so room is only available for MALE students. I am graduating this Spring, 2024, so I would like to transfer my lease, which will end in July 2024. The room will be ready to move in from May.
Room : $850.00 rent with $850 deposit
Room has access to a shared bathroom (3 housemates will share 1 bathroom)
Leasing details:
- 1-year lease
- tenants will be financially responsible for the room starting on 08/01/2024
- utilities (PGE/water/wifi): ~$50-100 depending on the season
Other info:
- in unit washer & dryer
- bedrooms are unfurnished
- beautiful park front of the house
- plenty of street parking
- 10min drive to Costco
If youâ€™re interested, please send me a little bit about yourself and any questions you may have. 

Address : 621 S 22nd st, San Jose, CA, 95116
Thanks
