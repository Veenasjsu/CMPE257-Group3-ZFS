Hi y'all,
Rising senior here looking for roommates to get an apartment with or a single room to move into. No gender preference, I'm nonbinary (he/they) so pls be comfortable w/ that if you respond. Ideally looking to pay 850-1000 a month & I'd be moving in early-mid May. I'm definitely more on the quiet/introverted side, but down to be friends if we click!

Interests & hobbies include cooking/baking, yoga, reading, anime, & going to concerts.

Cool w/ any current pets & 420 friendly :)). If all of this sounds like a good fit, hit me up with any offers/leads & we can move forward from there!
