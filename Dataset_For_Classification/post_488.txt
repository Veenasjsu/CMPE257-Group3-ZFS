Hello! 
My roommate and I are both SJSU alumni and are looking for a third roommate. 

We have a single bedroom with a shared bathroom that is available for rent. The monthly rent is 1075 plus ultilities and includes a parking spot in our carport. It is a one year lease that will start on August 1st! We have been living at this location for two years and really enjoy having our landlord. The location is about 10/15 minutes away from SJSU and about 5 mins away from Santana Row. Please message me if you are interested and for more details!
