Hi everyone! I have 2 rooms available immediately in a 3bd 2 bath at a luxury apartment complex. The apartment is tucked away in a gated community that is pet friendly which is safe and even has a beautiful pool view. The apartment comes with full amenities. AC, dishwasher, washer dryer etc. The complex also has a pool, hot tub, and a gym. The price is 1200 per month for the small room and 1300 per month for the big room before utilities which is about 40 dollars per person. It is right opposite to a rail station which is perfect if you don't have a car or if you're a transfer student. It is 12 minutes from SJSU and 9 minutes from SCU. Let me know if you're interested!
