Hey Everyone,ðŸ‘‹

Being an incoming freshman at SJSU, I'm hoping to find a room to rent as soon as possible close to the university for between $600 and $750.I recently moved from Minnesota and don't have a permanent place to reside. It's urgent, I humbly ask that you help me find a rental space.

Thank you,
