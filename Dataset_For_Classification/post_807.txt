Hi all! I am an incoming mechanical engineering transfer for this upcoming fall. I was looking for single in an apartment or house and my budget is $800-$1000. I am hoping to move in sometime in August. 

A little bit about me: I really enjoy being active, disc golfing, music/concerts, museums, and going out. 

Please let me know if you are looking for a housemate or hear anything!
