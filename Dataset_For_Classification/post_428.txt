URGENT!!!!!!

Hello!! 

Iâ€™m looking for a shared room as soon as possible before the start of next semester. My budget is $800 + utilities. The place must have a yearly lease and must be a good walking or biking distance from San Jose State University. Must be LGBTQ+ friendly, clean and respectful!

If you are interested, please message me!! Thank you!!!
