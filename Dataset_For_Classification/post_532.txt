Hello! My friend and I are currently looking for a group that has or is finding an apartment. The group has to be LGBT friendly or we will cry.

We are both clean, LGBT friendly, quiet, and respectful individuals who are looking for a place before July 13. I am an upcoming 2nd year majoring Biomedical Engineering while my friend is an upcoming 3rd year majoring Computer Science. We do not mind if the group is co-ed or all male. My friend plans to move in early August while I might move in early August or near the start of the semester.

The place has to be a good walking distance from campus because I do not have a car. Our budget together is anything around or under $1200 with utilities per month as we will be a sharing a room together. 

If you have any further questions, please message me here, Messenger (Reece Aralar), or text message (661-487-4682). Thank you!
