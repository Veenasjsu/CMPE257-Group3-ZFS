Hi Everyone!
I have a 4bd 2.5ba for rent starting 8/15/2023! The house is located in 95148 (close to Tully Rd. and White Rd.) Rent is $4500. Rent will include wifi (800 mbps) and all utilities (gas, electric, water, garbage). 1 driveway parking and plenty of street parking. There will be an in-home laundry hook up as well! If you have any questions or want to see the place, please reach out! :)

The home will come unfurnished but can be furnished if wanted at a cost.
