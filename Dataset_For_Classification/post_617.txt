Hi, Iâ€™m a senior at SJSU living at one south market and I have space for one single room and one shared room with 2 or 3 people. Rent for the single is 1300 a month and the double (master bedroom) is 900 each. the master bedroom has its own private bathroom and big walk-in closet. The place is a 10 minute walk from campus. I already have a couch, television, silverware/dishes, and most necessities here, just ask for more details. The lease would start in August. Contact me if you are interested!
