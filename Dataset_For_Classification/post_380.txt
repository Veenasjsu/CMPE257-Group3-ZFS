My partner and I are currently searching for a studio or 1-bedroom in San Jose /Santa Clara for rent. 

To briefly introduce ourselves we are working professionals at San Jose state. We both are calm, friendly and do not party, drink, or smoke. 

We would be more than happy to provide any references from our previous landlords and employers, and/ or do a background/credit check (if necessary).

Kindest regards,
Brandon
