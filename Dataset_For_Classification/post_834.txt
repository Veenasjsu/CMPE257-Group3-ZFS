Hi! We are 3 girls looking for a new roommate in a duplex that has been newly renovated. You would be sharing a room with 1 other girl. Its a 2 bed 1 bath home about 7 min walk and a 2 min drive from SJSU. We are looking for someone clean and considerate! There is also a washer and dryer available and parking is available as well. Rent would be $675 + Internet (usually $12.50 each month). We are looking for someone to sign a month to month lease starting June 1st! Message if you are interested :)
