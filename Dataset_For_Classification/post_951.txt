Hello! I am looking for someone (FEMALE ONLY) to take over my lease at The Grad from June 1st to July 31st (Move in date is flexible). It is a shared bedroom with a bathroom attached, so there will be two beds in the room, but nobody else will be occupying the second bedspace. The apartment is furnished and the living room comes with a TV. There will be two other roommates in the apartment but they have their own rooms and are super sweet! They also have a puppy but if you arenâ€™t comfortable with the puppy, they will keep it on their side of the apartment.

Amenities includes state of the art gym, yoga room, pool and hot tub, multipurpose room with a foosball table, and pool table! You can do a virtual tour at their website: [https://thegradsanjose.com/](https://thegradsanjose.com/)

The Grad is a 3-5 minute walk from SJSU and there are many places to eat and get drinks around.

88 E San Carlos St, San Jose, CA, 95112

Rent: 1215 per month (Utilities and internet included)
