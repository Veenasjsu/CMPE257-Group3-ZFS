Hello all,

I & my brother are looking for a private room and a bathroom (preferably in a townhouse) in a shared unit starting August 1st. Our budget is up to $1300. I need a parking spot as well. I'm a working professional, clean guy, who mostly won't stay at home except for the weekends. I would keep to myself most of the time yet I'm very friendly and would love to hang out and make friends and chill. have no other preferences. I'm looking for a place somewhere close to north San Jose or Milpitas. I'm open to starting a new lease as well.

Please do let me know if you have anything.

Thanks,
Harsha.
