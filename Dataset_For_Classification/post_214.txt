SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY

hey guys!! we are still looking for one last girl to join our group and look for places together!! we are hoping for a december move in and would really like to have a solidified committed group in the next week or so. there are three of us so far and we are looking at houses in the campbell/san jose area(not downtown). we have individual budgets of around 1000-1200 each and are hoping to find someone with a similar budget!! we also have a cat that will be moving to the house with us and he is the sweetest boy. if anyone is *seriously* interested please please hmu!! 

a little about me: i’m a 5th year molecular biology major and I’m graduating this spring (yay)!! in my free time i love going on hikes, seeing live music, and doing fun activities with my friends. we all really want to be friends with each other and have a comfortable living situation.
