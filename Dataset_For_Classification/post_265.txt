Hi everyone! I am looking for someone to take over my room starting ASAP.
It is a private single room (closet space included) with a shared bathroom in a house (all girls) located in downtown sj near Japan town.
Rent is $675 per month + utilities.
There are plenty of parking spots in both the front and the back of the house and it is around a 10~15 min walk to SJSU (3 min by car). 
Please message me if you are interested or have any questions!
