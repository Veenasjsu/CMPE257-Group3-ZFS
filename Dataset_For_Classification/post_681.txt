Anyone looking to sublease for the summer or looking to move into The Grad before August 19th:  

I’m looking to possibly sublet my room at The Grad until the end of July (female preferred). It’s a single with its own (detached) bathroom. It’s a 4-bedroom floor plan but with only me and my other roommate in the apartment (I would be switching to another room in the apartment if I were to sublet and leave in early July). The rent is $1575, with all utilities and wifi included. The apartment is very clean, on the 11th floor, and has in-unit laundry. The building has a pool deck (with a hot tub), a 24-hour gym, a yoga studio, a dog area, a multipurpose room, and study rooms. Since I’m switching to another room for the next leasing term, my current room is available for renewal. Meaning if you subleased you could do a straight renewal into August and not have to move in on August 19th. Normally at The Grad when you start a new lease you have to wait until a set date to move in (August 19th), but subleasing before the new lease bypasses that process. That lease rate (starting in August) would be $1675. Message me if you’re interested!
