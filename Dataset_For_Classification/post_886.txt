[Available, Female Only]
Hey everyone! I'm reletting a **double occupancy** room (Bedroom A) in a **D1** floorplan (floors **3-7**), where the lease starts August 19, 2023, and ends July 31st, 2024. Rent is $1223, with utilities included! This is an urgent post since I was planning on moving into The Grad next semester but was accepted into another school and need to find someone to take over quick.
* You would be sharing the space with someone else, but it's a very large room. There are separate closets and an attached shared bathroom.
* Super close to campus, probably around a 5-minute walk at most
* Fully furnished (**FULL XL** bed, desk, etc.) & in-unit washer and dryer
* Amenities: pool, fitness center, outdoor areas, study lounges

Please message me ASAP if you are interested or know someone else who would be interested!
