Hi everyone!
Me and my friend are looking for female roommates to join a new lease in an apartment around San Jose state university. Looking for friendly, responsible, and importantly vegetarian roommates to share the apartment.
Also, open to any vacant spots in an existing lease.
If interested reach out to know for further details.
