Hello everyone! I'm going to attend SJSU this fall and I need a room to stay at for a long time, or share a room with someone. My budget is approximately 800, with rent and shared utilities, and I'm planning to move around June/July. I don't smoke, drink alcohol, or do any drugs, and I'm not too picky with pets around. If anybody knows of something similar, please let me know.
