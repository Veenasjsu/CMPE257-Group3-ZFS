Hi everyone, I am looking for a roommate to split a 2 bed 2 bath apartment in San Jose. Budget is $2000

I am a 26 year old software engineer, and I work on site five days a week. Iâ€™m looking for somewhere that includes a parking space, as I will be leasing a car soon.

Looking to move in before the end of July
