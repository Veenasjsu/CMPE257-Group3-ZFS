Hello 
I am LOOKING for housing near SJSU. I am a Computer Engineering B.S student and I have about one year left. I am preferably looking for a private room under $1300 but am open to looking at other options. If anyone has a place please let me know and I am open to options outside of my preference. Also I can not start my lease until mid August.
