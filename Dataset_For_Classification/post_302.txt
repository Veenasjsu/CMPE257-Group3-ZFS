Hi everyone. We have a 9b9b coliving home in downtown San Jose avaliable for coliving. And we are renting out the house by the bedrooms furnished or unfurnished (with privately attached bathrooms) starting at $1500 utility included! 

We are hosting an open house Monday from 10-11am.

Please let me know if youâ€™re interested to come by and take a look.
