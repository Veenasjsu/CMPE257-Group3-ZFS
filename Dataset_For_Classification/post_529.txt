Hi everyone!! 
My name is Nick. I'm an incoming freshman as an English major. Unfortunately, I got waitlisted for student housing and am desperately looking for housing off campus. Preferably, I would like to be in a double or a triple. My budget is anything under $1000. I'm clean, respectful, and communicative. Feel free to reach out here or my Instagram @nadirashvilinikoloz
