Hello everyone, I am currently LOOKING for someone(MALE ONLY) to sublet my unit in a 4B apartment (Bedroom B) at the Grad.

The floor plan is D2, and it is conveniently located just a block away from the SJSU campus.

The rent will be $1629 per month, which includes utilities, wifi, and furniture. ( **I am willing to cover the difference to make rent $1500 a month. **)

Please message me if you are interested.

The lease will start from August 19, 2023, and end on July 31, 2024.
