Hello, 
Me and my roommate are looking for someone to takeover our lease by 15th October. The lease ends on 15th May 2024 (can be renewed/extended). It’s a 2bed1bath apartment in Mountain View, CA with the monthly rent of $3191 per month plus utilities. It’s at walking distance from Safeway, Costco and Caltrain station.

The apartment has east facing balcony which means plenty of natural light in the whole apartment. The balcony is pretty spacious with a storage unit. Also, the balcony doesn’t face other buildings/units. It faces the pool so no blockage of sort with respect to view and sunlight. There’s one reserved covered parking spot and bunch of unreserved parking spots in the community. The in unit washer and dryer are full sized and there’s also ac, heater, dishwasher, microwave, induction cooktop and oven. The apartment is in excellent condition. There’s also 24x7 gym. There’s amazon hub, swimming pool and hot tub. 

There’s one more male tenant who is interested and can be your potential roommate.
