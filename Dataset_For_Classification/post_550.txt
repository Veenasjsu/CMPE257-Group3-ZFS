Hello everyone, I'm looking for a private room for the upcoming year starting early/mid August. My budget is about $1100. Place must be close to campus, preferably in walking distance or accesible to public transportation. Don't mind sharing bathroom with another person. 

If you or someone you know has a room available, please reach out!
