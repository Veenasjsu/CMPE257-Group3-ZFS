Hi guys I’m trying to relet my room at The Grad. It is right across the street from SJSU. It is fully furnished all utilities included. It is on the 18th floor and is a premium bedroom with walk in closet and bathroom attached. I also have a parking spot if you’d like to take that over as well in order to not be put on the waitlist which is already full. Rent is 1575! Please let me know as soon as possible.
