Hey everyone! I am looking for female roommates to stay with at an apartment 5 minutes walk from SJSU (south campus). It’s a one bed, and one bathroom that is big enough to be shared by 3 girls (including myself) with a rent of about $665 per person. The move in date would be July 1st. If you are interested or know someone who might be interested, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me for more details! Thank you :)
