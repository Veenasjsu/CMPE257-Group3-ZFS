Hello! I have a spacious room available for SJSU students only. It is only a ten minute walk to SJSU. The room is a single occupancy room in a 4 bedroom house. The rent is $1095 per month (includes utilities). If you plan to have a car, it is an extra $35 per month to park in the driveway. Extra street parking is also available. Please PM me for more details.
