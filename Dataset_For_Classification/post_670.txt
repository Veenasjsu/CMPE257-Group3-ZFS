Hi!
I'm Sarah, an incoming transfer student to SJSU. 
I'm looking for a private room, but open to sharing a place too. looking for a place near campus. My budget is $600 - $800 a month. Hoping to move in August but flexible to move in July. 

Let me know if anyone has any leads or is looking for a roomate ✨️
