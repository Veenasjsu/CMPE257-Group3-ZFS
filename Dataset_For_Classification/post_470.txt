Hello everyone, my name is Heer. I am looking for housing in Palo Alto nearby Stanford University. I will be starting my internship in August and planning to move there around August 24th. I am clean and a non-smoker. If you are looking for a roommate do reach out. I prefer a girl roommate. Any help is appreciated!
