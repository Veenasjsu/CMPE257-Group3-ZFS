Looking for housing near SJSU, downtown or short commute. Budget is $1,350/mo. Shared room or private room. Safe parking preferred. I own Motorcycle and dont want it to get stolen.

About me: I’m 22 years old, active duty coastguard. Stationed in Puerto Rico and will soon be separating by early August. I’m sociable and physically active (olympic weightlifting and tricking). clean and responsible. Lover of league of legends. My instagram is @swugston which has more about me.

Thank you! 😎👍🏾
