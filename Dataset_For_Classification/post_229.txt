Hello everyone, 

I am looking for accomodation (private room) from mid January. Location preferences are in or around Sjsu or any other location which has easy access to public transportation would do. I am from Hyderabad, India, and I do not smoke or drink. If anyone has any leads, please feel free to ping me. 

Thank you in advance!
