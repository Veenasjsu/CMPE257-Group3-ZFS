Hello my name is Gabriel, I’m a senior and I just got back from studying abroad this fall. I am looking for a short term rental close to campus for the spring semester ideally February 1st or earlier to the end of May or later. I don’t smoke or have any pets and I am really just looking for a place to sleep and study. Please message me if you have or know of any available listings. 
Thank you!!
