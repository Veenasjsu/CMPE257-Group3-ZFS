I am currently seeking roommates to join me on a new lease right away. There is a room available in the 33S 3rd St Apartments, located in downtown San Jose. The apartment is conveniently situated just a 2-minute walk from SJSU. It is a spacious 2-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom duplex townhouse.
The living area, which has been converted into a large hall, offers ample space measuring 14 by 14 feet, and includes a private half bathroom. The rent for a single occupant is $1000, but if there are two occupants, the rent is $550 each. Additionally, a deposit and utilities will be required. The room is available immediately.
You will be living with working professionals who already occupy other rooms in the apartment. As they are mostly out during the day, you can expect a quiet living environment. While you will be sharing a shower, you will have your own personal bathroom.
Upstairs, there are two bedrooms, ensuring you have optimal privacy. The apartment itself is spacious and well-equipped with amenities such as a washer, dryer, air conditioning, and parking facilities.
Within a short 2-7 minute walk, you will find grocery stores, salons, cafes, restaurants, a library, a canteen, VTA transportation, and a light rail station. Your roommates are peaceful and helpful, and they also have a car, so they would be more than happy to take you to the grocery store or accompany you to the mall, and so on.
You can call me at 408-565-5496 for more details regarding the accommodation.
