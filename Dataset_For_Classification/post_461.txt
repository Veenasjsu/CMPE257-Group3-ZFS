Looking for accommodation:
Hi all,
I & my brother are looking for a private room and bathroom (preferably a townhouse) and looking to move in Aug 1st. Our budget is around $1200 and I need a parking spot as well. I'm a working professional my brother goes to SJSU for his Master's. We mostly keep to ourselves yet are very friendly and would love to hang out and make friends and chill.
We are non-vegetarian and have no other preferences at all.
I'm looking for a place around San Jose or Northside. I'm open to starting a new lease as well.
Please let me know of any leads.
(408)-228-7030
Thanks
