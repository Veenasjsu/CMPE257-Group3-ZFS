Hi Everyone!
I am Saniya, an incoming grad student at SJSU. 
I am looking for a private room, open to sharing, close to SJSU campus. My budget is $600 - $800 a month. I am hoping to move in around 1st August. 

Please message me if you have anything available, or are looking for roommates . Thank you âœ¨
