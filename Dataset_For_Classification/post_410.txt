Hello!
I'm Luis and I am looking to rent a room for 2 males with no preference to other genders who we will be renting with. I will be attending San Jose State University this coming Fall and just need a place to stay. We are looking to spend a maximum of $1,600 for both of us. Let me know if there are any accommodations!
