Hello all! 
My suitmate at the grad is looking for a roommate to share her double bedroom. She is the sweetest and cleanest person I’ve ever met and  my other suite mates and I really want her to stay but she needs a roommate. 

Some considerations:
-She is Muslim so ideally a woman who is Muslim would be amazing but if not that’s totally okay she just needs someone to be understanding of her beliefs. 
- she wakes up pretty early and works on weekends around 6 am 
 
The room is a master room which is pretty spacious and a walk in bathroom and a sliding door closet. 
Rent will be around 1250 and we have a shared kitchen and living room with a beautiful view of the pool. 
It is genuinely so so worth it so please let me know if you’re interested :)))
