Hi everyone!l I am looking for a shared room with my budget being 700 including utilities! I’m in an MSW program and I am very busy people throughout the day since I also work! I’m chill and just want a space I can use to study 😁 I have lived with roommates/ an apartment before so I’m familiar with living spaces and cleaning arrangements! I’m looking to move in August 1st, so i’m urgently looking for a space!
