ROOMS AVAILABLE IN 3BED/2BATHS

Hi everyone! 

I currently have two rooms opening in December  in a 3bed/2bath apartment located in the Santa Clara/Sunnyvale area near Nvidia. 15min drive from SJSU and 10min drive from SCU.

The rooms are two singles and would share a bathroom. Rent is $1100/month and utilities are approximately $50/month including Wifi, electricity, water, gas and HOA. 

The apartment is in a really nice complex with a pool and near a park. Really quiet and peaceful place. 

I am 23 and currently a graduate student at SJSU. I am looking for clean and responsible flatmates that I can get along with as I would love this place to be a safe place for everyone. 

Female only and not 420 friendly. Please messaged me with a little intro about yourself if you would be interested!
