URGENT!!!
WILL OAU FOR FIRST MONTHS RENT!
FULLY FURNISHED PRIVATE ROOM 1 BLOCK FROM SJSU CAMPUS!!!
I'm looking for someone (female) to sublet a space at The Grad beginning in august. It's a student living space right across the street from campus.
I'm looking to release a C1 premium room on the 15th floor with an attached bathroom.
When I was leasing my space they told me that the room is one of the biggest that they have in the whole building. There are many amenities including a gym, pool, walk in closet, built in washer & dryer as well as more that you can find on the website. The space is also pet friendly. I've lived here for the past year it's pretty cool. Super nice.
Message me if your interested or want more info!
