Hi all! I'm a young professional looking for a female housemate to move in on Oct. 1, 2023! The house is a 2 bedroom, 1 bath - 15 minute drive to SJSU in an awesome part of Santa Clara (walking distance to farmers market, SCU, & coffee shops/restaurants). Rent is $1457.50 + $40-50 for utilities monthly (private parking spot, washer/dryer, lots of street parking, home has porch, small front & back yard). It's a 6-month lease and then month to month. Feel free to message me directly if you're interested!
