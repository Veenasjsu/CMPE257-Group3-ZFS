**Hi everyone! I will be transferring to SJSU this fall for interior design and am searching for housing. I am looking for a private room and preferably female roommates. My budget is around $1200 but is flexible. I would also love to be a walking distance to campus, but I am open to different options. Please let me know if you have anything available or are looking for a roommate! Thank you**
