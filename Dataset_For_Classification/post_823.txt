Hello! Looking to sublease my room at the Grad for a “shared” room in a 3bd3b. I have not had a roommate the whole year so it is unlikely you will have it and so you will be paying $1176 a month for a private room. It is right next to SJSU and is within 100ft of the pool and lounge areas. Your move in date would be June 1st and the lease ends July 31st with potential for renewal.
