Hi, my roommate and I are looking for a female roommate to replace one of the current tenants. It’s a 2 bedroom, 1 bath apartment. Rent is $1200 with water and garbage included. Added utilities can be $50-$75 dollars a month. It’s 2 blocks from SJSU and a 15 minute drive to SCU! You would have a private bedroom with a full length mirrored closet. We are looking for someone to move in October 1st! 

A little about us: I’m currently a third year at SJSU, studying biomedical engineering, and Devonny is a first year transfer at SCU, studying computer science. Feel free to message us and we can set up a phone call or video chat!
