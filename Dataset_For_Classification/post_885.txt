Hey guys are you looking for a place to live in the fall? I am looking for anyone that is interested in taking over a lease at The Grad San Jose from August 2023 to July 2024!

The apartment is in downtown SJ and is a two-minute walk from the SJSU campus. The apartment has a D1 floor plan so you would get your own room in a four-bedroom apartment. The rent is about $1527 every month included with all the amenities you would get from staying here (Pool, barbeque area, jacuzzi, gym, in-house washer-dryer, game room, study room) Please let me know if you are interested!
