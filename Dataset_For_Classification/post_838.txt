[LOOKING] Hello everyone! I go by Wendy. I am a speech-pathology grad student from Los Angeles coming to SJSU for the Fall and I am looking for FEMALE ONLY housing and/or roommates (to start). If there is anyone entering the SLP program or from another grad program this upcoming semester that's awesome! I am hoping to move in at the start of August or end of July. I am clean, laid back, and introverted. I like anime, kpop (tho i'm not as heavily into it compared to before) and baking!
Preferably a private or double room. My budget is $900 or less but I can go slightly above. Please let me know if you would like to become roommates or have an availability in your housing. I am open to meeting via zoom or over the phone too! You can contact me through Messenger. Thank you!
