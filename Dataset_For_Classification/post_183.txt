Hi everyone! I am looking for someone to fill in my lease at 27 North beginning during the spring semester (Anytime after Dec20). The floorplan is attached below. There are currently 2 people living in one room and one in the other. (all women, students at SJSU).

This means if you are looking for a shared bedspace and bathroom for aprx 1100/month (1070 base + elec) which is a 7-12min walk from campus, this would be a great place for you! 

The apartment comes with a bed, walk-in closet, desk, and storage compartments. There is a shared TV in the living room, in-unit washer and dryer, a fully furnished kitchen, and a pool, lounge, game room, and gym to take advantage of throughout your duration there!

Please message me if you are interested or with any questions asap!!ðŸ˜„
