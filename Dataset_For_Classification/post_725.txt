Hi everyone! My roommates and I are looking for one more person to fill our other shared room. It’s a 2 bedroom 1.5 bath and we are looking for a female roommate. The rent is around $600 every month including water and wifi (electric is not included and varies every month). This apartment is half a block away from campus. We are friendly and clean, who’s looking for someone who is the same. Message me if you’re interested! :)
