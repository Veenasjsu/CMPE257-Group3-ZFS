SEEKING: 

Hi! I’m a recent graduate looking for a summer sublease. 
- move in ( june 20th ) since my job starts then. 
- move out (September 1st)
- My budget is around $800-$1100. A single is preferred. 

I love to cook, work out and hoop on my free time. I’m also pretty cleanly and likes to keep my room and kitchen tidy. Pls comment and message me.
