LOOKING for a room(probably shared) around $500-650 starting around mid-May.

I'd love to live in a clean environment with respectful and friendly people-- ideally other students who'd like to hang out and play a board game once in a while.

Me: I love cooking, board games, and the outdoors! I am a student and also working. 

Let me know if you have anything! (Please note I need to stick firmly to my price range!)
