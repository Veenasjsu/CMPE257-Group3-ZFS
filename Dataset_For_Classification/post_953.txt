Hi everyone,
I’m Looking for roommates/apartments starting from August '23.I’m an Incoming MS SE student at SJSU, as i got my visa approved I started looking for accommodation. I’m a non smoker, non vegetarian from Hyderabad and have no restrictions to share the space with.

Any leads will be appreciated.
