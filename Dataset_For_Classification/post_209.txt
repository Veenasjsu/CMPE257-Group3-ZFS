Hello everyone I will be attending SJSU for the Spring 2024 semester!
I’m one that values communication, respect, and open-mindedness. 

Some stuff about me:
- transfer student studying Communications
- I can speak 4 languages (kinda lol)
- I’m into film photography, guitars, martial arts, video games, and traveling (best place I went to was Japan!)

Hoping to move in the beginning of January and stay around the $900 range but I can make some adjustments if needed. 
 
Don’t hesitiate to message me if you have any more questions :)
