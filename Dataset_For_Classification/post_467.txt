Hello. I’m looking for a roommate. I have a 2x2 in Milpitas, near Great Mall. It’s 12-15 minutes away from campus. You will be sharing the master bedroom with Karla Kco, $900 per month plus utilities. It comes with washer and dryer in the unit, you get your own bathroom, there’s also a gym, study center, rooftop with pool and hot tub, and is walking distance from the mall, grocery stores, and the Milpitas Bart Station. 
If you would like to see pictures or get a tour, please comment down below.
P.S. You must be ok with having a cat in the room. 
Thanks.
