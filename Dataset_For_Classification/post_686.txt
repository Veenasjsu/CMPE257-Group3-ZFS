Hi everyoneðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š

Me and my friend are looking for additional female roommates this coming semester. We are looking into 3-4bedroom houses close by to SJSU within the range of having our rents less than 1k. A little about us we are both super friendly love to cook for each other and have movie nights and like to be clean and respectful. If you are interested in rooming with us please message me
