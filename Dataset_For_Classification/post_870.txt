Hi! My name is Olivia and I'm an incoming transfer student at SJSU. I'm 20 years old. I'm looking for roommates to look for a place with, or a room ready to move into. I'm hoping for a place to move into that's walking distance to SJSU. My budget is around $1000 and would prefer my own room. I am able to move in July or August. I am very clean, respectful, and outgoing.
