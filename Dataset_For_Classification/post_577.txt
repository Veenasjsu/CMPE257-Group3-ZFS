Hi everyone, I’m looking for male roommates for the upcoming year. My budget is upto $1100.  I’m pretty clean, friendly and respectful. In the meantime I love to play soccer or workout at the gym, cook a bit, watch TV and obviously finish up my school work. I’d prefer a private room but don’t mind sharing the room. In-unit laundry or laundry on site would be really great. I have all required furniture and would prefer to live at a walking distance from campus. Hmu if you’d be interested in being roommates
