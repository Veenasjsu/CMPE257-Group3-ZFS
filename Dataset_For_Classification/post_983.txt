[LOOKING for May - August 2023 housing]
Hi all,
I am a grad student interning in SJ for the summer. I am looking for accommodation in SJ starting from either May 1st- July 31st, or June1st to August 31st. Please let me know if you have any leads.
A little about me:
I'm very clean, easygoing, and respectful towards my roommates! My hobbies include cooking, going to the beach, and watching netflix/playing nintendo switch. I'd love to spend time with and get to know the people I'm living with if that's something they're also interested in.
