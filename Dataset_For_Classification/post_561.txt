Hello all! I am looking to take over a lease for a double occupancy bedroom or studio near SJSU that I can share with my girlfriend. Our budget is $1200. I am currently a student at SJSU and am also working. My girlfriend graduated last year and is currently working on her career. We are both in our early 20's. We do not smoke or drink. We are both pretty laid back and chill people.
Communication is important to us so we hope our housemates can talk to us for whatever needed. Some of my hobbies are hanging out with friends, listening to music, cooking, playing video games and board games, and watching movies! Some of my girlfriend's hobbies consist of hanging out with friends, watching anime and korean drama, playing video games and board games, and painting! We are both clean individuals and respect others privacy and follow house rules. Please reach out if you have any availability! Thank you!
