Hi there. I am looking for a female roommate to sign a new lease for a 2b2b unit in North Park Apartments, San Jose. You will have your own room, bathroom, walk-in closet, and attached patio with a great view! Centralized AC, heating, in-unit washer dryer, gym, pool, and various other building amenities included. Rent is $1550. Utilities(electricity and internet) are shared. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!
