Hey everyone, I’m looking for a private room close to SJSU campus preferably with parking (willing to pay extra). But am also open to Sunnyvale-san Jose-Milpitas area.  I’m very respectful of peoples space, & very clean I also wouldn’t mind carpooling to school since I do have a car. 

I’m a senior psychology major at SJSU , also work part time at a bank so I wouldn’t be at the place very often. 
My budgets $700-1000. Lmk if you have any openings ! Shoot me a message .
