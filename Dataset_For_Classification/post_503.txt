Iâ€™m entering my final year at SJSU studying Legal Studies and desperately looking for an open private room preferably close to campus. I currently live in Japantown and love it but unfortunately my housemates are all moving out at the end of our current lease. My budget is $1100 & would prefer to live with a clean, social, and responsible group. August 1st move in would be ideal. Thanks in advance!
