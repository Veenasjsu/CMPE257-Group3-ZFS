Looking for someone to sublease my apartment at “The Grad” San Jose. It has an amazing view of the city and has a spacious bedroom with it’s own bathroom. The amenities include a beautiful pool, dog park, game room, hot tub and more. It is a great experience but need someone to take over starting June. Contact me if you are interested! Rent is about 1500 and that includes all utility fees
