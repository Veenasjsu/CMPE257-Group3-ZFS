Hello all, 
I am looking for someone to take over my lease. It's $1240ish and has parking included (can forgo the parking for cheaper rent). It would be a shared bedroom. 2bd 2bath 4 total people. Male only.
Apartment is at 27N just 2 blocks from campus.

 PM for any questions and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
