I have an apartment at The Grad that I want to sublease over the summer break from June 1st through July 31st. 

It features: 
* Less than 5 minute walk from campus
* Your own single bedroom (which faces east and has morning light, but also has blinds)
* Your own bathroom
* Your own shower, vanity, and toilet. 
* Your own closet
* Good restaurants across the street

Our suite is on the corner of the building, so unlike most of the apartments at The Grad, we have large windows looking out in two different directions.*** I have only one suitemate who will be there over summer***. It's got incredible views of the University, the Diablo Range, and south to the Santa Cruz Mountains. 

The apartment comes with it's own washer/dryer, refrigerator, stove, oven, dishwasher, TV, your own closet, and furniture. My roommate and I already have many of the "shared" kind of kitchen utensils and cleaning supplies (such as pans, knives, soaps, kitchen bags) so you won't really need to worry about that. Please email me at ***edgar.mcgregor@sjsu.edu*** if you are interested. 

***The rent is about $1,450 per month, but since I'd have to pay that anyways, I'm will to take on some of the cost to help you out.*** My roommate is a 22yo male.
