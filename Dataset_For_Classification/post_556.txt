Good evening.  Our international students went home for the summer so we have a room available from July 1st through September 15th. If anyone is in need for a place to stay over the summer, let me know.  Single or double occupancy.  We are a loving American family.  We have a 19 year old son who works and goes to school full time, two friendly old dogs who sleep a lot. We are walking distance to to Oakridge Westfield Mall and lots of beautiful hiking trails.  Message me if interested.  Thanks!
