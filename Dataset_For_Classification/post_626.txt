Hi everyone!

We're looking for someone to sublease or take over the lease of a 1-bedroom with a private bath. The townhome is 1700 sq ft and the monthly rent is $1325.

The move-in date is from mid to the end of July, and the lease ends on November 1st, 2023 (approximately 3.5 months).

The townhome is brand new and has in-unit laundry and dual A/C for each floor.

Weâ€™re all working professionals in our early 20s super chill and friendly! Must be okay w/ a cat and dog.
