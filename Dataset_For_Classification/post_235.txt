*LOOKING/AVAILABLE 

Hi everyone! I'm posting again on behalf of my roommate who is moving out in December. I am looking for someone new to move in toward the end of November/beginning of December. Girls ONLY please. 

We're located just 7-10 minutes walking distance from campus on South 4th Street by the freeway entrance and the Spartan Gas Station. This is for a SHARED room, rent is $600 a month plus utilities, which are split evenly. 

Unfortunately, there are no extra parking spaces. We are alcohol and 420 friendly! If you're interested feel free to send me a message telling me a little about yourself. :)
