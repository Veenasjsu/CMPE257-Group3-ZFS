Hello. I’m looking for a roommate. I have a 2x2 in Milpitas, near Great Mall. It’s 12-15 minutes away from campus. $1700 per month plus utilities. It comes with washer and dryer in the unit, you get you own bathroom, there’s also a gym, study center, rooftop with pool and hot tub, and is walking distance from the mall, grocery stores, and the Milpitas Bart Station. 
If you would like to see pictures or get a tour, please comment down below.
Thanks.
