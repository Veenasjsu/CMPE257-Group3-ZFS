For females! 
Hi Iâ€™d prefer to find a single room for this year but a shared is okay too. 587.50 a month or $1,175 for a single room. Utilities are only $7.50 for wifi and $5-8 for electricity. Garbage and water are free! Laundry is on the first floor! This is right across campus and included are some photos. Priority given to single room interested people and shared right after!
