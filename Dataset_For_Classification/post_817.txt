I am looking for a short-term rental for an internship this summer from June 1st to Aug. 18th.  

What I'm looking for: 
• Dates and budget are flexible.
• Looking for something commutable to work (N. San Jose ideally)
• Has a kitchen. 
• Open to roommates.

I am a clean, respectful college student. In my free time, I like to hike and cook. Please reach out to me if you have a place in mind!
