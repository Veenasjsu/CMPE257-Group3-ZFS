Hi! My friend and I are looking for a place starting June 1st! I am graduating from San Jose State this spring, and she's a current student. We're each looking for our own room. 
My budget falls around $600-900 for a room, and her's is up to $1,000. 
Does not have to be near campus, but enough that she can access public transportation. 

Thank you!
