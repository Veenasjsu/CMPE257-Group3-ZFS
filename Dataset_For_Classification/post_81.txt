Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹. 
I'm a 22 y/o male currently working, and I'm looking for a single room in San Jose for around $1000/month. I don't have a strong preference for location, it's fine as long as it's not too far south and has accessible public transport. I want to move in around Jan 27. 
Please message me if you have any rooms, thanks!
