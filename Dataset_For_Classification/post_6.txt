Hi everyone, my friend is looking for someone to take over her room  in a three bedroom two bathroom apartment located in downtown San Jose. The other two roommates are male but the unit is coed. Less than five minute walk from SJSU. It is a large private room with a shared bathroom for $882 a month. Water, sewage, and parking included in rent. The unit is also pet friendly and available as soon as March 10th.
Please send a text to +1 (909) 919-8330 if you are interested!
