URGENT!!!!!!

Hello!! 

Iâ€™m looking for a SHARED room to move in and sign the lease as soon as possible before the start of next semester. My budget is $800 + utilities. I am mainly looking for a quiet and chill place/group. The place must have a yearly lease and must be a good walking or biking distance from San Jose State University. Must be LGBTQ+ friendly, clean and respectful! 

If you are interested, please message me!! Thank you!!!
