**URGENT- AVAILABLE **(Female)

My transfer process to UCSD has already begun and I'm currently looking for someone to take over my lease for the 2023-2024 school year at The Grad. The space I am reletting is a SHARED room in a D1 floorplan (4B,4B, one double room, and three single rooms) with the price being **$1,233 (utilities included).** However, because I'm desperately looking for someone to take over, I am willing to cover the difference to make rent **$950** a month or **cover all the pet fees** if you decide to bring a pet. The shared room has separate closets and one shared bathroom. Amenities include an in-unit washer and dryer, furniture, provided TV, new appliances and an apartment pool/deck, study rooms, lounge rooms, and many community events/giveaways. Please message me if interested or if you know someone who is.
