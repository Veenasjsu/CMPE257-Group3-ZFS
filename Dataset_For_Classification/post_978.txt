Hello everyone! I’m currently looking for someone to take over my lease for Sparta 505. The apartment is female only and the rent is around $1300 per month for a four bedroom apartment. You get your own room and there is a kitchen and in unit washer/dryer. You’ll share a bathroom with one other person and utilities are included with rent. Feel free to message me on instagram at @ariannanicole.osa for more details!
