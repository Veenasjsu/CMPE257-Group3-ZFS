Hello! 

My name is Kaya (they/she) and I am transferring this Fall as a journalism major. I am looking to move in by July 31st or August 1st and have a budget of $1,100. I am searching for a LGBTQIA+ and 4/20-friendly space, that can house me and my lovely sweet ESA kitty Buttercup. 

I have lived in Santa Cruz for over 3 years and in the same house for two years. I love to cook, write, read, thrift, vinyl shop, do makeup, occasionally play video games, watch some good movies or shows, and go on fun outdoor adventures. I really value a safe, communicative, and clean space where we can all hang out with each other or just be to ourselves. I am open to a co-ed space or getting a group together to find a house! 

Feel free to reach out to me if you're wanting to chat!
