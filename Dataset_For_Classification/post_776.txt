hi there!
I am Taarini, a CS student graduating from SJSU this month. Since my lease is ending soon, I am looking for a temporary accommodation (private room) until the end of August. I am very respectful, quiet, and organized and will be keeping to myself. Reach out if you have anything near the downtown SJ area! 
Thanks so much.
