Hi! My housemate (M) and I (F) are looking for a 3rd housemate to fill in a vacant master room in our 3bed/2bath apartment in North San Jose. We are minutes from downtown and 4 min from the airport. Move in around mid-August. 

You will have your own private bathroom with shared common areas. The room is large but I can find exact footage if needed. 

Rent is ~$1500 before utilities. We have in-unit washer and dryer and AC/heating. Parking is additional cost if needed. We also have access to the club house, 24 hour fitness studio and pool/hot tub.

We are both UC Davis grads in our early 20s that are working in healthcare. We’re both very clean, respectful, outgoing and friendly! I have a 1 year old female cat so must be pet friendly (-: 

Please message me if you’re interested or would like more details!
