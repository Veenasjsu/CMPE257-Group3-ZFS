Hello everyone, 

Iâ€™m Niharika a graduate student who will be relocating to San Jose this summer for my internship. I am in search of a  private bedroom for a short-term stay, ideally from last week of may to August 18th. The location should be in or around Sjsu or any other location which have easy access to public transportation would do. I am from Hyderabad, India, and I do not smoke or drink. If anyone has any leads, please feel free to ping me. 
Thank you in advance!
