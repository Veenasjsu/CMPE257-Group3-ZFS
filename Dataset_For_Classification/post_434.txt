Move-in date is 7/28 and the term is one year. Security deposit is 1.5 monthâ€™s rent. House is currently unfurnished, as we move in we will add furniture to the common area. There will be a total of 5 occupants in the house, plus a cat that will mostly be in its room with the owner. We are a mix of students and young professionals. Weâ€™re very friendly, non-smoking, like to keep the house clean and are looking for similar individuals to join us. We enjoy climbing, hiking, music festivals, and spending time outdoors.

I am reviewing applications now for immediate move-in! If youâ€™re interested in a viewing or applying, please comment below ðŸ™‚
