Hi All,

There is a private room available for rent in a comfortable 2-bedroom, 1-bathroom apartment located in the prime area of Santa Clara. The lease extends until December 1st, 2024, and the monthly rent is set at a competitive $1180. Move in date would be sometime in March (Flexible).

Situated at 2094 ROYAL Drive, this apartment is just a stone's throw away from the Nvidia campus, offering a quick 4-minute drive for those working there or in the surrounding tech hubs. Commuters will appreciate the easy access to both San Tomas Expressway and Lawrence Expressway.

For those who rely on public transportation, you'll find convenient bus connections along El Camino Real, a brief 5-minute stroll from your doorstep.

Parking is a breeze with one dedicated spot for the apartment, which you can coordinate with your roommate. Plus, there's an abundance of street parking available for guests or additional vehicles.

Daily errands are made easy with a nearby Target and other local amenities to ensure you have everything you need close at hand.

You'll be sharing the space with a 26-year-old professional male who is employed at Nvidia and occupies the second bedroom. He's friendly and respectful, making for a great living environment.

If you're interested or have any questions, please feel free to reach out for more information.
