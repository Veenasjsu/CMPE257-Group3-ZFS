Hello everyone!

I am an incoming grad student at SJSU who is DESPERATELY looking for a private room. My rent budget maximum is $1200 (if you have a room available for more, lmk anyways and maybe we can work it out), and I do have a car so I would need a parking space. I would prefer campus to be a 5-10 minute drive away, max. 

I am good with chores, I keep communal areas clean, I’m good to party with or chill with, and I take my academics pretty seriously. I don’t mind living with multiple genders, as long as everyone respects boundaries.

Let me know if anyone can offer me a room! Looking to start a lease August 1, 2023, can be month-to-month or more. Thanks!!
