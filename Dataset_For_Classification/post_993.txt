LOOKING for a room(can be shared) around $500-800 starting around mid-May!

No gender preference. 

Hi everyone! Iâ€™m an incoming junior transfer student looking for a room(can be shared) starting this fall. I found a few apartments for $1000+ but my budget is 500-800. Please contact me if you are looking for a roommate, we can also look for apartments that we can both afford and share together. 

Me: I am an electrical engineering student(male) and I will probably be in the library all day. I also dont have a car, so you can keep the parking space. I just need a clean and quiet place to cook and rest. Hobbies - gym, cooking, Netflix, video games, rave. 

Prefference:  a place closer to SJSU with a budget of $500-$800, a clean environment to share with respectful and friendly people. 

Please contact me for any leads! :))
