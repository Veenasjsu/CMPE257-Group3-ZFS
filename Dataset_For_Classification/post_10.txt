Hello!

I am looking for somebody who can sublease my room at The Grad in San Jose. The sublease is from June 1st-July 31st 2024, so it will be perfect for those looking for a short term stay for an internship or any other short business you may have near San Jose State University (2 blocks away from the west side entrance of the campus).

The unit has 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms on the 16th floor and fully furnished – I currently live with 2 other female roommates. You will have your OWN bedroom and bath with a shared living room/kitchen. The rent is $1587 – includes utilities (water, sewer, trash). You may need to get your own renter’s insurance. It's a pet friendly building (additional fee for each pet, on top of rent) .

Please contact me if you have any questions :)
