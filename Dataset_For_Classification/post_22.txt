Hello I’m posting this because there has been a lot of scams Me and my Partner almost got scammed today  by this person. I seen their listing and messaged them because I was interested, they send me a video tour and everything and conversted about the room. They then proceeded to give me their landlords information and I messaged them. Everything seemed very legit until they They started changing the group name and asking me questions like “what’s your favorite color” and being very exceeding about when I would fill out the application. I then proceeded to look them up and to surprise they has multiple posts about the same listing on multiple college groups that are not related to SJ.
