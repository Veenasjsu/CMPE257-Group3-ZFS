Hello I am looking for a private room by campus for this next Fall. My budget is ~950. I don’t mind it being Co-Ed.
-I am pretty clean and quiet, but can also be social. 
-I’ve never been told that I was a difficult person to live with. When there’s issues I tend to fix them ASAP. 
-420 and LGBTQ friendly. 
-Spend most of my time at school due to my studies.
