Hey y’all, 

My friend and I are looking for a 2b or a 1b shared room starting around the end of July. We both  are senior SJSU students looking for a place to stay for our last year. We’re super laid back and would love to make some new friends! Our budget is about $2000 max together but have a little bit of wiggle room with it.
