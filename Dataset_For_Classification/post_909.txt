Hello! I am from UCLA and I'm doing an internship at SJ.
I'm looking for a private bedroom and private bathroom (can be a studio or a part of a larger 2b2b for example) to rent from mid-June to end of August.
My budget is $1320 but I'm flexible with it. I have very neat living habits. I do not smoke. I clean regularly. Your place will be in safe hands ðŸ™‚
