Hey yall, I see a lot of listings for female only places and not as much postings for male college students. My roomate might be moving out and if thats the case, I'm planning on relocating and I'm looking for roomates. (I have a budget of 1150 per month).

If you are a guy looking for roomate(s) for next fall (move in this summer);
Cool with bringing over friends once in a while but not trying to party everyday;
Is willing to look around for a place;
And preferably in an engineering major and have some matching interests with me (hitting the gym, gaming, guitar, demo ranchüòÅ, and watching a movie once in a while) 
Message me and comment here. If we dont end up rooming, maybe you'll meet someone else you can look around with.
