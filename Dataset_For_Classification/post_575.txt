Looking for a roommate to take over the other bedroom in my 2b 1b apartment!! $900/month, not including utilities which is usually around $50-60 a month. Apartment is right across the street from SJSU, literally not even a 1 min walk lol. Message me for more details!! 
(Preferable someone whoâ€™s a grad student, clean, responsible, communicative, and likes dogs because I have a small dog!!)
