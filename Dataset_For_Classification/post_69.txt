Hi! We're a couple looking for a private bedroom with a private bathroom, available starting the first week of February. Our ideal location is between Palo Alto and Redwood City, in a gated community with parking. Our budget ranges from $1,800 to $2,500. We're open to either joining an existing lease or teaming up to find a new apartment. In our shared spaces, we value cleanliness and would prefer non-smoking roommates. No dietary restrictions. If you have any leads or are looking for roommates, please feel free to message me. Thanks!
