Hi, me and my friend are looking to rent 2 rooms. We are looking at houses right now but a lot of them require 3-4 people and it's just the two of us at the moment. Our budget is around $900-950. We also found some places as well but would need an extra person or two so if anyone wants to join us to look and secure a place together that would also work! Our lease ends at the end of this month but we're trying to move out by before that.
