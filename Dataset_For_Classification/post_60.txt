Mods: please delete if not allowed. Wanted to warn others about a shady landlord in north San Jose who would not return my security deposit after I moved out. After searching up his name in public court records he has several other small claims cases against him by other tenants who had their security deposit stolen. I see that his post is still up on craigslist so just wanted to warn others about this posting. The low rent price is likely used to lure people in.

Address of listing: 1071 Dewberry Pl Unit 308, San Jose CA 95131
Landlord Name: "Jay Liu"
