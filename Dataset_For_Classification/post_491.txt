Hii my roommates and I (all Master’s students ) are looking for a 5th person to join us to start a new lease in August at a 2B2B apartment 5 min walking distance from campus. It’s a spacious, window side living room spot : $550-580 rent w/o utilities. It will be 5 people total in the apartment. We are pretty clean and responsible people and expect the same from our 5th roomie ✨ We’re looking for someone chill & friendly who is an addition to the group, not a subtraction 🤓🧚🏽‍♀️

Feel free to reach out if you’re interested! 🙃

PS we have no issues if you drink/ smoke occasionally or are a non-vegetarian 🌿

Female only!!
