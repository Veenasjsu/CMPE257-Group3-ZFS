Hi! I am looking for a place to stay for the next AY preferably close to SJSU and prefer to have my own room and bathroom as well. (Shared bathroom with 1 other person is ok) Preferred move-in date is first week of August as I am moving from one apartment to another. My budget is around $1,000 - $1,500 (utilities included). I may have my girlfriend over most of the time but we like to keep to ourselves and stay in my room for the majority of the day (no disturbance). If you or anyone you know is looking for a flatmate, please let me know. TIA!
