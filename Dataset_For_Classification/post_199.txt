Looking for someone to take my place for January (female only please). 

Rent: $485 + utilities it's about $500 total

It's very close to campus 5-10 min walk (depending how fast you walk) and right next to Antojitos! 

3 very nice girls (Your roommate is super sweet). Your room is shared.

Let me know if you're interested!
