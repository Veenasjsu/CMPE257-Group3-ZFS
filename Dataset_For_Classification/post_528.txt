Hi all 👋🏼
I’m a senior graduating this Fall looking preferably for a short term lease August-December for a private bedroom (I don’t mind sharing a bathroom) in an all-girls home. A little bit about myself: I’m 25, transferred to SJSU last school year, pretty busy during the weekdays with school and work but on the weekends I love taking drives to Santa Cruz/new coffee shops/local farmers markets ☀️🌊 I know short term leases are a bit hard to come by so I’m also open to a year lease if there’s a good match! Let me know via message if you have a room available :)
