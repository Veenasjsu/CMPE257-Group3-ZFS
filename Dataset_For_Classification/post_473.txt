HI everyone, I'm a junior international student (and I have a roommate) looking for a room or two rooms for us. The budget is no more then 1200, the location is not too far from sjsu, and I would like to move in at 8/12 or early. If anyone has a open spot for housing please comment dwon below, thanks in advance.
