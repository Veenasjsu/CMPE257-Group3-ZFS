I am looking for a Roommate for my current lease in 2B2B, 1000Sq ft apartment near san jose Downtown. 
Apartment name: Mio Apartments
Location: 688 N 7th St, SJ, CA, 95112

Monthly rent(including Internet/Pg&e/utilities): around $800 to $1000 variable depending on the utilities bill and how many people share the room.
We are three people residing in the apartment currently, the lease can go upto 5 people. 
If anyone prefers a private room, we are okay with that too.
