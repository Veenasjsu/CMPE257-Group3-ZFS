Hi friends!!

My name is Isabel and I recently graduated from Chico State 🐾. 

I recently found out that I will be moving to the area for a fulltime job position. It is a short notice, but I hope to find housing/or a room to rent from early July/August 2023 (looking for a 12 month lease or month to month) 

A location by the SJ state would be great but not a deal breaker!

About me: 

- 💛I am coming from California, 22 years old and will be turning 23 in November.

- 💜I’m very clean and respectful. I’m hoping to find roomies who would like to do things together even if it’s just watching movies + eating pizza 🍕. I respect alone time as well, it is important. 

- 💛I enjoy doing activities such as: going on hikes, trying new foods, watching movies, cooking/baking, outdoor activities, going out, painting, reading. My list can definitely go on😇.

- 💜 I’m a lash tech on the side 🙂
