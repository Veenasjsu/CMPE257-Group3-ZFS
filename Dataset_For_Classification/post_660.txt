Hello! My roommate and I are incoming SJSU graduate students looking for a FEMALE ONLY doubles spot to fill in. Our budget is from $700-900. We would like to find a place at least 20 mins walking distance away from SJSU campus as well as a spot for one car. If anyone is interested in getting a 2bd2bth with us, we do have a list of places but will need help to tour units because we currently are busy over the summer in SoCal. If interested please feel free to contact me!
