Looking for someone to sublease a spacious room with a shared Jack and Jill bathroom. I have been living in the space for a year and a half and have loved it, but sadly I must move back home for clinicals. Looking for someone who is clean, respectful, easy to get along with, and is preferably a student or young professional. 
 
You will be in the upper level of the house with 4 other people and a sweet medium-sized dog. There is a downstairs studio that will be subleased as well, currently, a lovely couple is living there. The kitchen and living room are shared spaces with a spacious backyard and basement for storage. 
 
Other amenities/perks:
- Parking spot included
- WIFI included in rent
- Monthly house cleaning included rent 
- washer and dryer
- 10-minute walk to SJSU, Japan Town, and grocery stores
