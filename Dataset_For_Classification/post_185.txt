Hey all!
ONLY FOR FEMALES
Accommodation available in Master bedroom in *Sunnyvale*. It is 2b2b apartment and my current roommate is moving out. The apartment has all the amenities except for laundry, which is in the community. There is a swimming pool and game room in the community.

I’m a clean, vegetarian, non-drinker, and non-smoker and expect the same from my roommate.

- Move-in date: Immediate(flexible).
- Rent: $1450 + utilities which includes PG&E and Wifi (≈$50)
The location is really great and walkable from a lot of stores (CVS, Dollar Tree, Ross, Safeway, Sprouts and a lot more) and 5 mins away from the bus stop.
