üè° Roommate Wanted Alert in Downtown San Jose! üè°

Hello everyone! We've recently leased a spacious 2B2B apartment and are on the lookout for a tidy and respectful roommate. This opportunity is ideal for female students, working professionals, or a couple who appreciate downtown living.

The available bedroom is spacious, filled with natural light, and comes with an attached closet and private bathroom. It can comfortably accommodate an individual or double occupancy - we are preferably looking for female roommates in case of sharing.

The monthly rent will range between $1600-$1700, not including utilities, and it's a year-long lease.

Our apartment boasts a prime location - it's a stone's throw away from San Jose State University, the MLK Library, and the SRAC gym. It's also in close proximity to public transport hubs (VTA, BART, Diridon Train Station), shopping centers like Whole Foods and Bargain Market, and the lively San Pedro Square.

The apartment is part of a gated community featuring an on-site gym. Our shared living room and kitchen are well-equipped and sunny.

We're in search of a roommate who doesn't smoke/vape, respects personal space, and maintains cleanliness in common areas. Occasional weekend parties are fine, and we have no restrictions on veg/non-veg food.

If this sounds like your ideal space, don't hesitate to drop us a message for more details or to arrange a visit. Let's create a harmonious living space together!
