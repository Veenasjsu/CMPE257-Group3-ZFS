Hii!

I am currently looking for someone (preferably female) to relet a shared bedroom with attached bathroom (bedroom A) at The Grad apartment from August 2023 to July of 2024. The monthly payment is ~ $1276, utilities included and the room is fully furnished as well. My floorplan is a C2 floorplan, where you will be sharing the common space with other roommates. The apartment is five minutes walk from the campus.

Let me know if anyone is interested!!
