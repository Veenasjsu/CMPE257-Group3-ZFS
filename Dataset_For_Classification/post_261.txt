Hi everyone! My name is Katie and Iâ€™m a 5th year molecular biology major graduating this spring! This might be a bit premature but Iâ€™m starting to look for potential roommates to look for houses with! Iâ€™m hoping to find 3 people(so 4 of us total) who are looking to move sometime over winter break(Dec-Jan). I have a couple people who are interested already but we are still looking for some people who are fully committed to the idea.  We are trying to find a house or townhouse in the Campbell/Cambrian Park area but are super open to looking elsewhere. I have the sweetest cat, Clive and I already have a fully furnished home so I will be bringing all of my furniture with me! If anyone is interested in moving around then and wants to try and look for places together please hmu ðŸ™‚
