Hello!

I'm a female De Anza student transferring to SJSU next year and looking for somewhere close by! Preferably a studio to live alone, but roommates are acceptable as long as loud company is absent (I am extremely tired of living with roommates that have extremely loud friends over every single day). My max budget is $1000! Thanks a ton!
