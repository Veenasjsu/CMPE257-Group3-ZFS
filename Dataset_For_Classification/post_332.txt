(NO PETS unfortunately ðŸ˜”) - 1 Year Lease

Hi everyone, Leo and I are looking for 2 more people to join in on a lease in Santa Clara. One room is currently available and the other room will start around September 30th, 2023. Rent is $1,084 per month for the regular room. Utilities and wifi are separated. 

Some background about us:

Iâ€™m Daniel 23 yrs old. I graduated from Kingâ€™s College London 2 years ago and currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer and doing a master's degree in Engineering Management at Santa Clara University. Likes to boulder, practice martial arts, play guitar/ukulele, play volleyball with friends, make sushi and other fire japanese food, and hike around.

Leo:
Hey there, I'm a 21-year-old software engineer based in Sunnyvale, CA. When I'm not immersed in coding and creating software magic, you can find me exploring the great outdoors through hiking, seeking out new gaming adventures, and hitting the gym to stay fit. I'm a true foodie at heart, whether it's whipping up culinary delights in the kitchen or savoring delicious dishes from around the world. As a recent grad, I'm excited about my journey in the tech world and can't wait to continue balancing work with my love for travel, experiencing new places, cultures, and cuisines.

Feel free to message if youâ€™re interested!
