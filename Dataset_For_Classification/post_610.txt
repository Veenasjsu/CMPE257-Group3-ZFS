Hi everyone! 3 month lease but will probably be EXTENDED.

We're looking for someone to sublease or take over the lease of a 1-bedroom with a private bath in a 3-bedroom house.The townhome is 1700 sq ft and the monthly rent is $1325.

The move-in date is from mid to the end of July, and the lease ends on November 1st, 2023 (approximately 3.5 months) but we are looking for this to be extended. 

The townhome is brand new and has in-unit laundry and dual A/C for each floor. The room has a walk in closet and private bathroom.

Weâ€™re all working professionals in our early 20s super chill and friendly! Must be okay w/ a cat and dog.
