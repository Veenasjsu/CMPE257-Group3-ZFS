Hi there, my girlfriend and I are either looking to rent a room or take over a lease. We have a flexible budget since it’s a two income house and would preferably like somewhere close to San Jose state university. Please message me if you think we would be a good fit. Ps. We don’t have pets nor smoke at all.
