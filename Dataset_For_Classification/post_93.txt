AVAILABLE, female ONLY. Hi all! I’m looking for a female to take over my lease this summer sometime from early June to mid August (dates flexible, pls reach out!). I live @ The Grad in downtown SJ and it’s right across SJSU and super close to public transit and a lot of food/shopping/offices. I’m in a furnished 4 bedroom apartment, you’d be taking over my single room and single bathroom. Utilities covered in rent + there’s a pool/jacuzzi/gym. Please reach out for more info!
