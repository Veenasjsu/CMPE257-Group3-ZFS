Hi! Currently looking for a few roommates to live with this coming fall semester 2024. Im hoping to move end of july to early August. My budget is 1250 per person, for ONE room, not room sharing. I don’t smoke or drink (very very little drinking). I’m willing to commute to campus, 10-15 min drive at most. Please message me if interested!! :)
